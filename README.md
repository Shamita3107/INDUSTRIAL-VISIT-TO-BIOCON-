# Industrial Visit to Biocon✨ — Visit Summary

**Date:** 23 December 2025

On 23 December 2025, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) organised an industrial visit to Biocon, giving students valuable exposure to real-world biotechnology research and insulin production processes. This visit provided a close look at the Research & Development (R&D) department and the production steps for raw materials used in insulin manufacturing.

## Summary
During the visit I explored Biocon's R&D workflows, saw practical aspects of insulin production, and learned about the quality and regulatory checks that support medical-grade manufacturing. The experience was motivating and strengthened my interest in bioinformatics and biotechnology.

## What we saw
- Guided tour of R&D facilities and labs  
- Overview of upstream and downstream processes in insulin production  
- QA/QC procedures and documentation practices used in regulated biomanufacturing  
- Discussion on raw material sourcing and process control

## Key takeaways
- Real-world biotechnology workflows rely heavily on rigorous quality control and reproducible processes.  
- Interdisciplinary skills (biology, data analysis, process monitoring) are essential in modern biotech settings.  
- Exposure to industrial research helped connect theoretical coursework in bioinformatics to applied lab and production environments.  
- Seeing end-to-end production pipelines clarified how data and analytics can support process optimisation and compliance.

## How this connects to my studies
- Bioinformatics skills can support process data analysis, assay interpretation, and automation of QC checks.  
- Understanding manufacturing constraints helps design computational workflows that are practical and compliant.  
- The visit highlighted potential project areas (process analytics, predictive maintenance, data-driven QC).

## Next steps
- Follow up on contacts or materials from the visit to learn about internships or project collaborations.  
- Explore a small project using anonymised process data (e.g., basic monitoring dashboard or data-cleaning pipeline).  
- Read introductory resources on bioprocessing and regulatory requirements to align computational projects with industry needs better.
